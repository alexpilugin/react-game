# react-game
I plan to create a simple interactive game to check my skills in React.<br />
1st step: planning:<br />
![Planning](./preparation/planning.jpg)<br />
2nd step: **npm install -g create-react-app** (It was done before)<br />
**create-react-app my-react-game**<br />

I added .gitignore with "node_modules/" file to ignore all directories called node_modules in current folder and any subfolders.
